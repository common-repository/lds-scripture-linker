== Upgrade Notice ==
LDS Scripture Linker Version 2.9 is now available!
Version 2.9 fixes it so that references already linked are skipped.  In other words, if a reference begins with a ">" then it will NOT be linked by my plugin.  For example:
<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org">D&C 89:10</a>  will be skipped
I also implimented some design suggestions offered by Jeff Stone from http://www.gospel-doctrine.com
I recommend you update to the latest version.
